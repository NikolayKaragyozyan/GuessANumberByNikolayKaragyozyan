Guess The Number - The Rules

Guess The Number is a game where you must use your logic in order to guess a secret number selected by the computer at the beginning of the game. The number is formed with digits from 0 to 9.

This number is guessed by you via multiple attempts. An attempt consists in a proposed number, selected by you, and the computer's reply. 

Using information from the computer's reply, you must guess the number using as few moves as possible. Good luck!
